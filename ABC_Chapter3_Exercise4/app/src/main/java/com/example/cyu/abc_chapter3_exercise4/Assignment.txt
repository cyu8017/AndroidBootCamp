Case Project 3-4: Chicago Can Fare App

Requirements Document

Application title: Chicago Cab Fare App

Purpose:
Create an app that estimates the cost for cab fare in Chicago. The app calculates the cost of the
trip and requests a reservation for a smart car, traditional sedan, or minivan.

Algorithms:

1. The app requests the distance in miles for the cab ride and your preference for the requested
   cab: a smart car, traditional sedan, or minivan. The can fare has an initial fee of $3.00. The
   mileage rate of $3.25 per mile is also charged.

2. The app displays the name of a cab company, a picture of the logo, and the results of the
   requested type of cab with the cost of the fare. Create your own layout.

Conditions:
Use a theme, Spinner prompt, string array, and hint property. Decimal mileage is possible.
