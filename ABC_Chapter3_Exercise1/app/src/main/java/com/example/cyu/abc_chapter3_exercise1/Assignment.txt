Case Project 3-1: Catalina Island Boat Express App

Requirements Document

Application title: Catalina Island Boat Express APp

Purpose:
Catalina Express has 30 daily departures between Long Beach and Catalina Island.
Create a simple app that determines how many boat tickets the user needs and whether the ticket is
going to Catalina Island or heading back to Long Beach. The app displays the total price for the
fare in one direction.

Algorithms:

1. The app displays a title; an image; and a Text Field, Spinner, and Button control (Figure 3-37).
   The two options in the spinner control include To Catalina Island and To Long Beach. Each single
   passenger ticket is $34 for one way.

2. When the user taps or clicks the Button control, the number of tickets and the total cost of the
   fare is displayed. (Figure 3-38).

Conditions:
Use a black theme, Spinner Prompt, string array and hint property.
