Case Project 11-2: Home Mortgage Interest App

Requirement Document

Application title: Home Mortgage Interest App

Purpose:
The Home Mortgage Interest App computes the total interest paid for the life of a home mortgage
loan.

Algorithms:

1. The opening screen displays an image (mortgage.png) and the title Mortgage Loan Interest

2. The user enters the amount of their monthly mortgage payment, number of years (10, 20, or 30)
   which must be converted to months, and the initial principal of the loan. Save these values using
   the SharedPreferences object (Figure 11-24).

3. In the second Activity, retrieve the three values and compute the total interest paid over the
   life of the loan with this formula:

   Total Interest = (Monthly Payment * Number of Months) - Initial Principal

4. The second screen displays the result of interest paid with an appropriate (ten.png, twenty.png,
   or thirty.png) for a 10-, 20-, 30-year loan (Figure 11-25).

Conditions:

1. The four images are provided with your student files.

2. The result should appear in currency format.
