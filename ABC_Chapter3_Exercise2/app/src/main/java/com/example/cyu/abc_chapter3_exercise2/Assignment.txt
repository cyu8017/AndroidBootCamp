Case Project 3-2: Triathlon Registration App

Requirements Document

Application title: Triathlon Registration App

Purpose:
A triathlon registration app allows an athlete to register for one of three national triathlons to
qualify for the Ironman World Championship.

Algorithms:

1. The triathlon registration app has two Text Fields: One requests the number of athletes on the
   user's team ($725), and the other requests the location. A Spinner control allows the athlete to
   Select one of the three possible locations: Lake Placid, Big Island Hawaii, and Miami. The app
   also displays a title, an image, and a Button control (Figure 3-39).

2. After the user taps or clicks the Button control, the selected location and the total team cost
   are displayed in a TextView control (Figure 3-40).

Conditions:
Use a theme, a title, an image, a Spinner prompt, a String array, and a hint property.
