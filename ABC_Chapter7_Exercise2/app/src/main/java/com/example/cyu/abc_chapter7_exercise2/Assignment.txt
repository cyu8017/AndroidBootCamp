Case Project 7-2: New Seven Wonders of the World App

Purpose:
Wikipedia would like you to build an ap to showcase the new seven wonders of the world and allow
users to select any monument to see a large picture.

Algorithms:

1. The opening screen should display in a grid the seven images representing the new seven wonders
   of the world - Great Wall of China, Petra, The Redeemer, Machu Picchu, Chicken Itza, Colosseum,
   and Taj Mahal (Figure 7-31).

2. When the user selects a monument image in the GridView control, a larger version of the image
   appears below the GridView. A toast message states which monument image the user selected by
   number (Figure 7-32).

Conditions:

1. The pictures of the seven wonders of the world are provided with your student files with the
   names wonder1 through wonder7.

2. Display each image in the GridView control with four images across each row, and use a column
   width of 60dp, horizontal spacing 3dp and vertical spacing of 3dp.
