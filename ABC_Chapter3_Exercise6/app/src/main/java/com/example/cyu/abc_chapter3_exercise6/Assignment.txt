Case Project 3-6: Piggy Bank Children's App

Requirements Document

Application title: Piggy Bank Children's App

Purpose:
A piggy bank app allows children to enter the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that
they have. The child can select whether to save the money or spend it. Calculate the amount of
money and display the amount that the child is saving or spending. Create two screens: a welcome
screen and an input/output screen.

Algorithms:

1. A welcome screen displays the title, image, and button that takes the user to a second screen.
   The input/output screen requests the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. A Spinner
   control should indicate whether the children are saving or spending their coins. Create your own
   layout.

2. The results display how much the child is saving or spending.

Conditions:
Use a theme, Spinner prompt, string array, and hint property.
